= `@JsonbCreator` property naming test

On Java records, you can define an empty public constructor which can be used for
both annotations and validation (but not for logic).
While Jsonb-implementations will pick up the `@JsonbConstructor` annotation,
they will fail to apply the default naming strategy.
You MUST sync with your naming strategy, which is repeating yourself and error-prone.
